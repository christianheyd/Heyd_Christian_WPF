Assignment: Conditionals - Wacky

This script is based on something I was trying to do in the prior assignment, but

make it work.

*/

alert("How much would you weight on another planet?");
var weight = prompt("How much do you weigh on Earth?");
console.log(weight);

var heavenlyBody = prompt("Please select an object of the solar system from this list. Case sensitive! \n- The Sun \n- Mercury \n- Venus \n- The Moon \n- Mars \n- Jupiter \n- Saturn \n- Uranus \n- Neptune \n- Pluto");
console.log(heavenlyBody);
